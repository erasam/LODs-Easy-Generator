# LODs-Easy-Generator

This project was born to make life easier for Microsoft Flight Simulator aircraft developers (as I am) using Blender as the 3D development platform

One critical topic any Microsoft Flight Simulator aircraft developer must deal with is the creation of different levels of details (LODs) of the aircraft as this is required by the simulator in order to keep the impact on the performance as low as possible.
Normally this task is one of the latest in the aircraft development process as the LODs are created from the final version of the 3D model (the base full version) in order to avoid to repeat it after changes are applied

There are actually several freeware and payware add-ons available for Blender trying to make easier the creation of different level of details for the objects of a scene but they normally create copies of the involved meshes applying to them algorithms to reduce progressively their level of details: unfortunately this approach makes them useless for the development of an aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator as the mesh names are used throughout the implementation of the model behavior 

Note: all my current payware aircraft creations for Microsoft Flight Simulator have been published on the in-game marketplace and SimMarket site by AeroSachs
